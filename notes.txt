I decided to drop the fennel stuff for now, I overestimated my ability to learn fennel in a couple of nights.

As soon as I finish this week's game I'll jump back on the fennel train

In the meantime I have implemented the most basic flexbox system imaginable as my first step.

My main idea for the game:
- Use the midi controller to change the frequency/amplitude of your wave to match another wave
- Potentially have addition/subtraction in the mix
- Try and make it a similar art style to the previous game, very basic and use SODs (maybe even use them to juice up the waves)
- Scope will need to be extremely limited - make this an arcade style game like the previous memory game

This might be the biggest rush yet - I only have my flexbox implementation complete and it's already Tuesday!


2025-02-05
- Completed basic wave form rendering
- Basic layout is complete for the level
- Couldn't work out how to directly interface the midi controller with love2d so I opted to: read the values using a python script -> write those values to a file -> read the file using love2d

Right now I'm feeling pretty good about being able to finish this by the deadline

2025-02-06
- I made the midi output affect the frequency/amplitude/shape
- I fixed the wave output view
TODO:
- wave goal view is still likely broken - needs to be redone in the same way as the wave goal

2025-02-07
- I have fixed the wave goal box
- wave overlay box is created
- still need to add a compatibility check
- level ui is complete (score + timer)
- Game loop is now operational
- Timer implemented
- Wave compatibility implemented

Priority List:
- Game over screen needs to be completed (with logic to restart the game)
  + Done
- Rebalance the levels
- Test on laptop
